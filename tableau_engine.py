Tableau Engine - Unified Tableau Construction System

This module provides a unified tableau construction engine that supports multiple logical
systems while maintaining industrial-grade performance and theoretical correctness.

The engine is designed around the principle of pluggable logical systems where each
system defines its truth conditions, tableau rules, and model construction methods.

Key Design Principles:
1. **Theoretical Soundness**: All tableau rules correctly implement formal semantics
2. **System Agnostic**: Works with any logic system that implements the required interfaces
3. **Performance Optimized**: O(1) closure detection, α/β rule prioritization, subsumption
4. **Research Ready**: Supports complex logics like wKrQ with restricted quantifiers

Supported Logic Systems:
- Classical Propositional Logic: Complete two-valued tableau system
- Weak Kleene Logic (WK3): Three-valued logic with undefined value propagation  
- Ferguson's wKrQ: Four-sign system with epistemic uncertainty and restricted quantifiers

Academic Foundation:
Based on Smullyan's unified notation for tableau systems with extensions for
non-classical logics following the formal development in:
- Smullyan, R. M. (1968). First-Order Logic. Springer-Verlag.
- Priest, G. (2008). An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic. Cambridge University Press.
- Fitting, M. (1991). Bilattices and the semantics of logic programming. Journal of Logic Programming.
- Ferguson, T. M. (2021). Tableaux and restricted quantification for systems related to weak Kleene logic.

Performance Characteristics:
- Closure Detection: O(1) using optimized literal tracking
- Rule Selection: O(log n) priority-based selection favoring α-rules
- Branch Management: O(1) amortized branch creation and indexing
- Memory Usage: Linear in proof size with aggressive subsumption elimination
